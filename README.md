# CSharp Repository Pattern using Console

In this project, I've implemented the repository pattern in C# to create a console-based user interface. The repository pattern is a design pattern that provides an abstraction of data, so that your application can work with a simple abstraction that has an interface approximating the collections of objects in memory. It adds a separation layer between the data and domain layers, making the application more scalable, testable, and maintainable.

The console application allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a virtual player database. This database is created within the application as a static source, simulating interactions with a real-world database.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or contributions.


## Installation

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Visual Studio.
- You have a Windows machine, as Visual Studio is not available on Linux or MacOS.

## Installing <PlayerRepository>

To install <gh repo clone Shahariar-Rokon/CSharpConsole>, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `gh repo clone Shahariar-Rokon/CSharpConsole`.

2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**: Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and double-click on the `PlayerRepository.sln` file to open the project in Visual Studio.

3. **Build the project**: Go to `Build > Build Solution` to build the project and check for any errors.

4. **Run the project**: Press `F5` or go to `Debug > Start Debugging` to run the project.

## Using <PlayerRepository>

This is a simple console application. When you run it, you will see a console with options numbered 1 to 7. Each number corresponds to a specific action:

1. **Option 1**: Shows the list of players in the database.
2. **Option 2**: You can search specific Id of player in here.
3. **Option 3**: You can add new player to the database.
4. **Option 4**: You can update a existing player in the database.
5. **Option 5**: You can delete a specific player in the database.
6. **Option 6**: Clears the console.
7. **Option 7**: Exit the application

To perform an action, simply enter the number associated with that action. You can test the application by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the virtual player database.

When you're done, enter the number for the "Exit" option to close the application.
